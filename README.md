# QTM 2600 - Linear Algebra
## 1. Preface ## 
This is the repo where I keep class notes and assignments for the Linear Algebra course at Babson. Though there isn't a native Python component, I felt that this was a good opportunity to practice using Numpy and get more familiar with using python for linear algebra

## 2. Conventions ## 
#n  = These are plaintext, one-line notes
'''text''' = These are plaintext, multiline notes
```python
def func(x,y):
    print(example function)
``` 
^ = code blocks within markup files. Notebooks just use code cells.
